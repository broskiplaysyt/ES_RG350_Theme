ES RG350 THEME
Theme by Voilola based on "Pixel" by Rookervik
Almost all the logos and console images created by Ruckage
Version 1.0

---------------------------------------

I decided to publish this theme for Emulation Station, optimized for the resolution of RG350, even if it's not finished yet.
I hope someone can finish it, expand it and improve it.

The version of Emulation Station I've used is a bit old (but fully functional on RG350), so many functions have not been implemented.

The version of ES that I used: https://github.com/ManuelSch81/RG350-EmulationStation_configured/tree/master/frontend_start
